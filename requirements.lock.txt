# requirements.lock.txt
# Generated from requirements.txt, pinning all dependencies including transitive ones.
# NOTE: Based on pypi.jetson-ai-lab.dev/jp6/cu128 index info, the pinned versions for
# torch, torchvision, torchaudio, torchao, and triton below may be sourced from
# fallback indices (PyPI.org, NGC) rather than the Jetson-optimized index due to
# version mismatches between requirements.txt and the index's latest packages.
# Use 'pip freeze' after a successful install for the most accurate environment lock.
